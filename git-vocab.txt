Series 1:

I grasped the idea of git and version control systems on the 16th Dec, 2018.

Meaning of git repository

A git repository allows is a virtual storage of one's project, it allows you to save versions of your code which i can access when needed.

Terminologies i immediately learnt are;
1. Centralized systems
this system where all there is only one central server that contains all the codes of everyone

2. Distributed systems
this is why git exists, it is a method of storing codes of different individuals who work as a team on their various systems, leading to various copies of code on everybody's system,
rather than one server.
